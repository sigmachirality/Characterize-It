Characterize It Instructions
---------
Thank you for your interest in Characterize It! Here's what you should do:

1) Watch this short video explaining our project and how to contribute: https://vimeo.com/331325026

2) Navigate to our HIT on Mechanical Turk Worker Sandbox: https://workersandbox.mturk.com/projects/36TBNKR9195HAVZCYI1HY0GW5HODEY/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw

3) Accept and complete as many tasks as you would like.

You will be asked to look at an image of a comic book character and describe the character with 3 adjectives related to physical appearance, 3 adjectives related to personality or persona, and 3 adjectives related to emotions evoked. 

Make sure that your adjectives are all different and spelled correctly as we will be checking this in our quality control. You may submit when all boxes are filled out.
